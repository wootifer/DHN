Introduction:

This is a repository of reproducing this paper: Palmprint and Palm vein recognition with Deep hashing network onTensorflow platform.

Python3, Tensorflow 1.8.0

Content:

data.py obtain Hamming distance between hashing codes.

code.py obtain hashing codes of images.

nets.py the network structure.

plot.py this is used for draw DET curves

**.txt  image path.
